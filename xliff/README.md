Use `grunt xliff:*` commands to convert between localization source json
files, in `www/locales`, and xliff versions in this directory. The xliff versions are for interchange with our translation provider.

Usage:

* `grunt xliff:from_json`: create xliff copies json source files
* `grunt xliff:to_json`: *overwrite* json source files with transformation
  of xliff files.
