      If you login with this mobile client, or via the website, your password will exist in the {{= s("SpiderOak") }} server memory during your browsing session. However, your password will be stored in encrypted memory and never written to an unencrypted disk. The moment your browsing session ends, the copy of your password is erased, with no trace left behind.
